# Tests for the scoped prompt-rule wiring a consumer copies in to get the reply-shape
# and workflow reminders WITHOUT the audit, PR-review, or verdict gates:
#
#   templates/codex-hooks.json     -> $consumer/.codex/hooks.json        (whole file)
#   templates/claude-settings.json -> $consumer/.claude/settings.json    (merge "hooks")
#
# Neither reads the pinned checkout. The consumer commits its own copy of
# rule-recency.sh, so the rules are a snapshot that ages instead of following the pin.
# That trade is the point of the design, and it rests on one assumption worth testing
# rather than believing: that the hook still works once it is no longer inside the
# plugin tree. If it ever grows a sibling dependency, a ${PLUGIN_ROOT}, or a relative
# source, every consumer copy breaks at once and nothing upstream notices — the copies
# are invisible from here.
#
# The rest guards the two JSON files. Both hosts validate strictly and reject an
# unknown key by loading no hooks at all. Codex does it WITHOUT LOGGING ANYTHING — that
# was confirmed the expensive way, when an early draft carried a `_comment` key
# explaining the file and the end-to-end runs came back with the injection missing and
# no indication why.
#
# The nested `hooks` array inside each event entry is REQUIRED, not decorative. It was
# double-checked against Anthropic's own installed security-guidance plugin and a
# working .claude/settings.json, because a plausible-looking flattened form
# (command objects directly in the event array) is the obvious wrong guess.
#
# Run with:  bash templates/prompt-rules.test.sh
# Exits non-zero on any failure.
