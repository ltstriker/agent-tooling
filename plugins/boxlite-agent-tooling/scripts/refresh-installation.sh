# Advance the recorded tooling revision to the current tip of tooling.ref.
#
# This is the ONLY place besides the bootstrap that touches the network, and it is
# never on the commit path: sync-installation.sh spawns it in the background after
# lifecycle events, throttled by the last-check stamp, and the gates keep verifying
# against the existing record until an adoption completes. Adoption itself is
# delegated to the consumer's committed install.sh — one canonical path that
# validates before it records, so a broken tip is fetched, rejected, and never
# becomes current.
#
# Best-effort by design when the network is the problem (offline is a normal state
# for a laptop), loud when the configuration is the problem (a broken profile or an
# unusable installer would otherwise fail silently forever).
