#   sync-guidance.sh [--check|--force] [repo-root]
#
# Default mode SPLICES: every existing AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md (symlinks resolved,
# duplicates collapsed to one physical file) gets the block replaced in place or
# appended after its own content; a repository with neither file gets a fresh
# AGENTS.md holding the block plus a thin CLAUDE.md bridge (`@AGENTS.md`), the
# layout every host reads natively — Codex recognizes only AGENTS.md, Claude Code
# only CLAUDE.md (inlining the import), Copilot either.
#
# --check VERIFIES without writing, for the commit and push gates: a missing,
# malformed, or hand-edited block exits nonzero (integrity is fail-closed, like a
# stale installation); a block merely behind this plugin's canonical text only
# warns (consumers float same-ref, not same-revision). Layout advice is sync-only
# so gates never nag on every commit.
#
# The begin marker records rev (the tooling commit that last changed the block —
# informational) and sha256 (first 12 hex of the block body's hash — load-bearing:
# a body that no longer matches its own marker was edited by hand, which is how
# the gate tells tampering from ordinary staleness). The block is byte-stable: an
# unchanged body is never rewritten, so adopting new tooling revisions produces no
# consumer diff churn.
#
# Mutating committed files is an EXPLICIT-invocation privilege: lifecycle-triggered
# installs (sync-installation.sh repair, refresh-installation.sh polling — both set
# AGENT_TOOLING_SYNC_ACTIVE=1) defer the splice, so a background refresh can never
# dirty a worktree. A target with uncommitted tracked modifications is skipped with
# a warning for the same reason; untracked files are fair game (the first install
# creates them). AGENT_TOOLING_GUIDANCE_FORCE=1 equals --force, for reaching force
# through the consumer's install.sh.
