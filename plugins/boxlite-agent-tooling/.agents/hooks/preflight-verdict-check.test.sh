# Tests for .agents/hooks/preflight-verdict-check.sh (the Stop-stage verdict gate).
#
# The hook is DETECTION-TRIGGERED, with finding-driven loops only:
#   - no dossier + the turn asserts a verdict ("root cause is X",
#     "tests pass", "prod looks healthy", "done")      -> block: audit it
#   - no dossier + chat / question / no transcript     -> allow
#   - present PASS/IN_PROGRESS, fresh + matching       -> allow (consumed)
#   - present FAIL, fresh + matching                   -> block with findings
#     (the ONE legitimate loop: persists until re-audited clean)
#   - present but stale / mismatched binding           -> DISCARD, re-detect
#     (bookkeeping never blocks — that was the meaningless-loop class)
# Each case builds a throwaway git repo with an optional fake transcript and
# dossier, runs the hook there (cwd + CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR pointed at it), and
# asserts allow vs block.
#
# Stop contract: block = stdout {"decision":"block"}; allow = exit 0 with either
# empty stdout or {"continue":true, systemMessage:...} — the systemMessage is the
# human-only triage announcement (the model never sees it; documented hook
# contract). decide() treats any non-block output as allow.
#
# Run with:  bash .agents/hooks/preflight-verdict-check.test.sh
# Exits non-zero on any failure.

# starting point regardless of the caller's environment. Absent now means HARD, so
