# Stop hook: gate the end of a turn on an audited verdict
# (see .claude/agents/verdict-auditor.md).
#
# DETECTION-TRIGGERED, finding-driven loops only. The trigger is the WHOLE FINAL
# TURN — every assistant text since the last real user message, read deterministically
# from the transcript: if it draws a conclusion the reader must take on TRUST — one
# whose evidence is not shown in the turn itself — the turn must end with a fresh
# dossier (.agents/state/last-verdict.json, written by the
# verdict-auditor subagent). Chat, questions, and in-progress narration end freely.
# Turn-level, not last-fragment: findings asserted mid-turn cannot hide behind a
# closing "let me check X" (that miss shipped once, caught by a sibling session's
# decision log).
#
# Flow:
#   1. Dossier present, binding fresh + matching:
#        PASS         -> allow (consumed)
#        IN_PROGRESS  -> allow with note (consumed)
#        FAIL         -> block with the findings — THE one legitimate loop: it
#                        persists until the findings are addressed and a re-audit
#                        passes. A loop driven by real findings is the point.
#   1b. No dossier, but run-verdict-audit.sh is RUNNING — audit_in_flight() decides,
#        on the lock's presence, its PID's liveness AND its freshness bound:
#        allow — the answer is being computed and no amount of re-blocking speeds it
#        up. Its verdict gates the NEXT turn end.
#   2. Dossier present but stale / mismatched (branch, HEAD, tree, age):
#        DISCARD it and fall through to detection. Never block on bookkeeping —
#        "the binding moved" is not a finding, and blocking on it was the
#        meaningless-loop class (e.g. a commit moving HEAD out from under a
#        dossier written seconds earlier).
#   3. No dossier: TRIAGE the turn text through a three-tier cascade, cheapest first,
#      so the 5-10s model round-trip is spent only where it actually decides anything:
#        A. harness noise (0ms)  — the assistant slot holds only text the HARNESS
#           wrote (API errors, quota notices, interruption markers). No model produced
#           it, so it cannot be a claim -> allow. 14.4% of real turns.
#        B. assertion-only (0ms) — a high-precision SUBSET of the fallback list below,
#           limited to forms that report an observation ("173/173 tests pass", a
#           whole-line "done.", a line-initial "Verified …") -> block. 10.7% of turns.
#        C. the model (5-10s)    — everything else. "Is this a conclusion the reader
#           must take on trust, with nothing shown that produced it?" A
#           fast model (haiku) answers YES/NO; when no model is reachable the static
#           pattern list below decides (deterministic fallback, e.g. sessions without
#           a model CLI). YES -> block with the audit instruction; NO -> allow
#           (announced to the human via systemMessage, invisible to the model).
#      No transcript (absent / unreadable / zero bytes) -> allow; nothing to judge.
#      A transcript WITH content but no assistant text is NOT that case — the hook
#      could not SEE the turn (unflushed final message, or a torn write jq could not
#      parse). It waits up to 2s for the text, then fails open under a `blind-allow`
#      rung so the log distinguishes "quiet session" from "gate never looked".
#
#      Tiers A and B are latency work ONLY — neither loosens the gate. A stays sound by
#      requiring EVERY non-empty line to be harness text, so a turn that errored and
#      retried still reaches B/C. B stays sound by leaving every prose-ambiguous
#      phrasing ("tests pass", "root cause is", "deploy is healthy") to the model:
#      removing the static false positives is the whole reason the model is primary,
#      and a turn merely DISCUSSING verdict phrasing must still be allowed.
#   4. Flush-race guard: the harness can fire Stop before appending the turn's final
#      message, leaving the PREVIOUS (already-gated) message last in the transcript.
#      The hook records the uuid it judged; if the newest uuid equals it, the hook
#      waits briefly for the fresh message and, failing that, allows — a message is
#      never judged twice.
#
# Wired in .claude/settings.json under hooks.Stop (no matcher — fires every turn end).
#
# Design notes
# ------------
# * Triage is the auditor's applicability judgment, extracted: the full verdict-auditor
#   already begins by deciding whether the message asserts anything verifiable. The
#   hook runs that ONE question on a small fast model (~seconds, message-only context)
#   so the expensive audit is spawned only when the answer is YES. Any classifier
#   failure — CLI absent, timeout, garbage output — degrades to the static pattern
#   list, and a pattern miss degrades further to the agent's CLAUDE.md duty: every
#   failure moves toward #915's honor system, never toward a trap. A false positive
#   costs ONE synchronous audit that trivially PASSes — a tax, not a loop. Fenced
#   blocks and multi-word code spans are stripped before triage so documentation ABOUT
#   verdicts does not trigger. The CLASSIFIER additionally keeps single-token spans,
#   because they are citations and its question turns on them; the pattern tiers keep
#   the old text, since anchoring on a token pulled to line start loosened them.
#   VERDICT_CLASSIFIER_CMD overrides the classifier (tests use stubs; set it to
#   `false` to force the regex path).
#
# * KNOWN TRAP, unfixed: "never toward a trap" covers CLASSIFIER failure only. When the
#   AUDITOR is unreachable, run-verdict-audit.sh exits 1 with no dossier and no rung
#   tells that apart from "no audit attempted", so the turn cannot end until the API
#   recovers. Needs the runner to signal unavailability.
#
# * Why no loop can form: validation runs BEFORE detection, binding mismatches discard,
#   and audit_in_flight() allows while the bash runner works. FAIL-with-findings is the
#   only repeating block, which is the requirement. A Task-launched auditor leaves no
#   process to observe and so still re-blocks. Do NOT re-derive this from "the audit is
#   synchronous" — that instructs the model, and the harness ignores it.
#
# * Tree-hash binding: at stop time the work is usually UNCOMMITTED (HEAD has not
#   moved), so HEAD alone can't tell "audited" from "changed since audit". The dossier
#   binds to a content-addressed hash of the full working tree via a throwaway index +
#   `git write-tree` (deterministic; no timestamps; never touches the real index). The
#   verdict-auditor computes it the SAME way. On mismatch the dossier is discarded and
#   the CURRENT message re-detected — so a real verdict still demands a fresh audit,
#   while a chat ending after the tree moved is not trapped.
#
# * One-shot consumption: the dossier is `rm -f`'d on every exit path except a
#   fresh+matching FAIL (kept so the finding-driven block persists across attempts
#   to end without addressing it).
#
# * Soft mode is NOT enforcement: the Stop hook's systemMessage is shown to the HUMAN
#   only — the model never sees it (documented hook contract; only a block's `reason`
#   reaches the model). Soft mode exists as telemetry / emergency rollback (flip
#   VERDICT_GATE_HARD_BLOCK=0 in settings env; it propagates mid-session). Default: hard.
#
# Threat model & accepted limitations (this gate catches HONEST mistakes, not a malicious
# parent — the parent and the auditor share one filesystem + toolset):
#   - NOT forge-resistant: the parent can write the dossier itself. Real tamper-evidence
#     needs a signer the parent cannot impersonate (a harness-level capability) — a shell
#     hook cannot provide it. Out of scope by design.
#   - NOT evasion-resistant: a verdict worded outside the pattern list is not detected.
#     The patterns are a curated, tunable list (below) targeting how claims are actually
#     phrased; misses degrade to #915's self-declared behavior, never to a trap.

# Fenced blocks go entirely: verdict phrasing quoted inside one is documentation, not a

#   * multi-word (`tests pass`, `root cause is`) — quoted prose. Stripped, same reason.
#   * single-token (`preflight-verdict-check.sh:262`, `audit_in_flight`) — a citation.
# Stripping BOTH deleted exactly the evidence the triage question asks about, so a turn
# that carefully cited its sources reached the classifier as fragments and got judged
# more harshly than one that asserted the same thing vaguely. Single tokens keep their
# text and lose their backticks so they read as ordinary words.
# TWO strippings, because the tiers want opposite things and a single one silently
# loosened tier A. Keeping a span's text drops its delimiters, which can pull the token
# to the START of a line: `API` Error handling is fixed → "API Error handling is fixed",
# which harness_patterns anchors on, so an assertion left through the top of the cascade
# with no model call. `Request` was aborted and `Credit` balance is too low do the same,
# and `Done. #1161` defeats the $-anchored done. assertion.
#   * static  — every span removed. What harness_patterns, assertion_patterns and
#               verdict_patterns were written against; they match multi-word PROSE, so
#               removing citations costs them nothing and keeps their anchors honest.

# it can never be a verdict, and spending a 5-10s model round-trip to learn that is
# pure latency. Measured on this repo's transcripts: 81 of 563 real turns (14.4%) are
# exactly this, led by "API Error: 400 Your input exceeds the context window" (x43)
# and "No response requested." (x15).
#
# EVERY non-empty line must match — that is the soundness property, and it is why
# this is not a heuristic about content. Anchoring only the FIRST line would leak a
# real verdict whenever the model hit a transient error and then retried inside the
# same turn ("API Error: Overloaded" followed by "Root cause is X. All 53 tests
# pass."). Both variants catch the same 81 turns, so the strict one costs nothing.

# ── Shared re-audit instruction (used by every block path) ───────────────────
# The block `reason`s below are the gate's UX + anti-cheating contract — what Claude
# reads when a verdict is detected unaudited, or a declared verdict FAILed. Invariants:
#   • Direct Claude to invoke the verdict-auditor subagent SYNCHRONOUSLY (Task with
#     run_in_background: false) — a background audit's completion event is what
#     created the #892 loop; a synchronous audit keeps audit and verdict in one turn.
#   • The AUDITOR — not Claude — writes ${verdict_file}. Claude must not write or
#     hand-edit the dossier (that is grading its own homework / confabulating proof).
#   • Offer the honest exits: IN_PROGRESS if not actually done; a `blocked` proof
#     entry (with residual risk) if proof genuinely can't be produced in this env.
#   • After the auditor reports, end the turn again; this hook re-checks.
#
#   • When a prior audit FAILED on this same work, hand its findings to the auditor so
#     round N+1 re-checks them against the delta instead of re-deriving every claim
#     from cold. A function, not a string, so the prior-dossier note reflects state as
#     it is at BLOCK time rather than at definition time.
#
# Variables available: ${transcript_path} ${branch} ${head} ${verdict_file}
verdict_instruction() {
  local prior="" tooling_root

A PRIOR audit of this same work FAILED; its findings are in ${prev_verdict_file}.
Re-check THOSE findings against what changed and carry forward the proof entries
whose evidence still holds, rather than re-deriving every claim from scratch. Still
read the WHOLE turn — narrowing applies to re-verification only, never to finding
claims, so anything the fix newly asserts is still caught."

Audit before ending — run the audit SYNCHRONOUSLY (the dossier
must exist before you end), via WHICHEVER of these your harness supports:

Claude Code:
  Task(subagent_type='verdict-auditor',
       description='verdict proof check',
       prompt='Audit my final turn — every assistant message since the last real user
               message: each claim it presents as established, mid-turn or closing, must have
               concrete, direct proof in the evidence — the working-tree diff, the
               commands and their output in the transcript, or cited files/logs. A claim
               backed only by guessing or indirect inference is NOT proven. A turn that
               asserts nothing verifiable is a PASS. transcript_path: ${transcript_path}')
       (run_in_background: false)

Any other agent (no Task tool):
  bash '${tooling_root}/.agents/hooks/run-verdict-audit.sh' '${transcript_path}'

The AUDITOR — not you — writes ${verdict_file}; do not write it yourself. If you are
pausing or asking the user something, have it record IN_PROGRESS with what remains;
if a claim genuinely cannot be proven here, it can mark that proof 'blocked' with the
residual risk. Then end your turn again.${prior}
