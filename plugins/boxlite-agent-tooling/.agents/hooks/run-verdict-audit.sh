# Feeds the procedure in .claude/agents/verdict-auditor.md (frontmatter stripped)
# as the system prompt to a model CLI with Read/Bash/Write tools, which audits the
# transcript's final turn (all assistant text since the last real user message,
# mid-turn claims included) against the working tree and writes the
# dossier (.agents/state/last-verdict.json). Succeeds only if the dossier lands.
#
# Model resolution (same seam pattern as the triage classifier):
#   1. VERDICT_AUDITOR_CMD — full override; invoked with the audit prompt on stdin;
#      must leave a dossier behind. Per-harness config, tests stub it.
#   2. claude CLI — headless with the auditor spec as system prompt, tools
#      whitelisted, hooks disabled (no nested gates), 10-minute cap.
#   3. Neither → exit 2 with instructions (the caller sees why).
#
# Exit codes: 0 dossier written · 1 audit ran but no dossier · 2 no runner available.

# rejected. The removal sits inside each branch, not above them: the no-runner path
