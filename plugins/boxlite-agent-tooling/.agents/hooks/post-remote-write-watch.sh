# PostToolUse hook: after a successful remote write, tell the agent to arm a
# Monitor on the pr-watch event stream.
#
# This is the Claude Code *consumer* of the watch. The producer is universal —
# .githooks/pre-push starts .agents/watch/pr-watch.sh for every agent and every
# human. This hook only bridges that stream into a Claude session. Codex,
# opencode, and humans read the same log directly.
#
# Registered from .claude/settings.json (hooks.PostToolUse, matcher "Bash"):
# the vendor directory registers, .agents/ implements.
#
# Design notes
# ------------
# * Advisory, not `decision: "block"`. The push has already happened, so a block
#   cannot undo it — it can only nag. Worse, the auto-fix loop this arms itself
#   ends in a push, so a hard block here would deadlock that loop.
#
# * Matcher scope: PreToolUse/PostToolUse matchers are tool-name-only, so this
#   registers on the broad `Bash` matcher and does its own filtering, exiting 0
#   immediately on unrelated commands. Same shape as
#   .agents/hooks/preflight-commit-push.sh:55 and preflight-pr-review.sh:52 —
#   segment-anchored so `echo "git push"` does not match, newline-normalized so
#   a verb on line 2 does.
#
# * `git push` is matched, but so are the `gh pr` writes. The pre-push arm
#   already covers PR creation transitively (a push always precedes it), so the
#   gh cases exist to re-attach a Monitor in a session that pushed earlier, or
#   where the push happened outside this session.
#
# Tests: bash .agents/hooks/post-remote-write-watch.test.sh

.githooks/pre-push has armed the watcher. Arm a Monitor on its event stream now,
in this exact form:

  Monitor({
    command: 'bash ${repo_root}/.agents/watch/pr-watch-stream.sh \"${event_log}\"',
    description: 'CI checks + PR comments on ${branch}',
    persistent: true,
  })

Each line is one JSON event. Kinds: check (one per check as it concludes),
checks_done, comment, review, review_comment, watch_start, watch_end.
The stream ends itself at watch_end — do not arm a second Monitor for this
branch, and do not poll \`gh pr checks\` by hand while it runs.

When an event arrives:
  * bucket 'fail' or 'cancel' -> read the real failure with
      gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
    then follow ${repo_root}/.agents/watch/escalation-policy.md, which decides
    what you may fix unattended and what needs the human. Read it before editing.
  * a new comment or review    -> summarize it for the user; apply the same
    policy before acting on it.
  * send a PushNotification for a failing required check ('Lint (conclusion)',
    'Test (conclusion)') AND for every new comment,
    review, or inline review thread — bots included. Reviewers are why the
    watch exists; an unread bot finding is the failure mode it is meant to
    prevent. Routine passing checks stay silent.

If the user asked you not to watch this one, skip the Monitor and say so."
