# PreToolUse hook: gate `git commit` / `git push` on a fresh audit verdict.
#
# The verdict comes from the commit-push-auditor spec
# (.claude/agents/commit-push-auditor.md), spawned by whichever built-in the running
# agent has. This gate never produces it.
#
# Flow on a denied attempt:
#   1. Hook denies the git tool call.
#   2. Reason text names every route to an auditor; the agent takes the one it has.
#   3. That auditor writes .agents/state/last-audit.json.
#   4. Parent retries -> hook reads the artifact and allows on PASS.
#
# Wired in .claude/settings.json under hooks.PreToolUse with matcher "Bash".
#
# Design notes
# ------------
# * Matcher scope: settings.json registers this hook on the broad `Bash`
#   matcher, not a narrower `Bash:git*` pattern, because Claude Code's
#   PreToolUse matchers are tool-name-only — there's no built-in way to filter
#   on the bash command itself. The script does the actual filtering via the
#   case match below and exits 0 immediately on non-target commands, so the
#   per-invocation cost on unrelated bash calls is one jq parse + one regex.
#
# * One-shot consumption: the audit file is `rm -f`'d on the allow path
#   (intentional, see end of script). This forces a fresh audit on every
#   subsequent git commit/push — even at the same HEAD — so re-staged content
#   between commits can't ride on the previous audit. The cost is that
#   commit-then-push of the same HEAD must re-audit; the user has accepted
#   this trade-off to avoid stale-audit-passes-new-content failure modes.
#
# Tests: bash .agents/hooks/preflight-commit-push.test.sh

# Match when the command actually IS a `git commit` / `git push` invocation —
# at the start of the command OR at the start of any chain segment (after &&,
# ||, ;, |, &, $(, (, `, or a NEWLINE). This catches the chained-command case
# (`cat foo && git commit ...`) AND the multi-line case (`cd foo\ngit commit ...`)
# that an anchor-only matcher misses, while still rejecting literal mentions of
# "git commit" inside string arguments (e.g. `echo "git commit"`), which don't sit
# at the start of a chain segment.
#
# Newline handling: a verb at the start of a physical line runs as a real top-level
# command, exactly like `;`/`&&`. Normalizing newlines to `;` makes the existing
# separator logic catch it. Without this the verb on its own line slips past the
# matcher unaudited (fails OPEN — a silent bypass). Cost: a `git commit`/`git push`
# token on its own line inside a heredoc/message body may falsely match (fails
# CLOSED — a spurious re-audit, never a bypass). Closed-over-open is the right trade.
