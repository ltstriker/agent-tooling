# PreToolUse hook: gate `gh pr create` / `gh pr edit` / `gh pr ready` on a
# user-TYPED acknowledgment that they have reviewed the PR.
#
# `gh pr create --draft` (and `-d`) is intentionally excluded — draft PRs are
# not yet requesting review, so no ack is required.
#
# Flow on a denied attempt:
#   1. Hook denies the gh tool call.
#   2. Reason text instructs the parent agent to obtain a TYPED confirmation
#      from the human (not a yes/no click) and persist it verbatim to
#      .agents/state/pr-reviewed.json bound to current branch + HEAD.
#   3. Parent retries -> hook validates the marker and allows on match.
#
# Wired in .claude/settings.json under hooks.PreToolUse with matcher "Bash".
#
# Design notes
# ------------
# * Matcher scope: same reason as preflight-commit-push.sh — PreToolUse matchers
#   are tool-name-only. This script does the actual `gh pr <subcmd>` filtering
#   and exits 0 immediately on unrelated bash calls.
#
# * Draft detection caveat: the `--draft` / `-d` check matches anywhere in the
#   raw command string. A title like `--title "[draft] foo"` would falsely
#   skip the ack. The user has accepted this — quoting `--draft` inside an
#   arbitrary string is rare and the failure mode is "let one PR through
#   without ack," not a destructive action.
#
# * Two deterministic content checks run before the ack gate — a Conventional-
#   Commit `--title`, and a `--body` carrying the before/after call graph
#   (CONTRIBUTING.md #commit--pr-messages). Both only fire when the flag is
#   actually present and inspectable; neither consumes the ack marker.
#
# * One-shot consumption: the marker file is `rm -f`'d on the allow path so
#   each successive gh pr command forces a fresh ack, even at the same HEAD.
#   Mirrors the trade-off in preflight-commit-push.sh.
#
# Tests: bash .agents/hooks/preflight-pr-review.test.sh

# segment (after &&, ||, ;, |, &, $(, (, `). Same shape as the git matcher in
# preflight-commit-push.sh so chained invocations are caught.
#
# Treat a newline as a command separator (same as `;`), so a `gh pr create` at the
# start of a later line (`cd foo\ngh pr create ...`) is caught. An earlier version
# scanned only the first physical line to dodge heredoc bodies (e.g. `gh pr create`
# appearing in commit-message prose), but that left the newline bypass OPEN — a real
# `gh pr create` on line 2 slipped past unaudited. Closing the bypass wins: the cost
# is that a `gh pr create|edit|ready` token on its own line inside a heredoc/message
# body may falsely gate an unrelated command (fails CLOSED — safe), which is rare.

# TODO(user, learning-mode): author the ack instructions Claude reads on every
# deny. This is the actual UX of the gate — keep it tight, unambiguous, and
# anti-cheating.
#
# Constraints the message MUST satisfy:
#   • Direct Claude to obtain a TYPED reply from the human (not AskUserQuestion
#     click, not Claude inferring "the user already said yes earlier").
#   • Specify the exact shape the user must type. The hook validates the
#     marker's `.message` field with the regex defined in REQUIRED_MESSAGE_RE
#     below — keep the two in sync.
#   • Tell Claude where to write the marker (path shown via ${marker_file})
#     and what JSON shape: { branch, head, message }.
#   • Forbid Claude from fabricating the message or paraphrasing the user.
#
# Variables available for interpolation:
#   ${command}      the exact gh command being gated
#   ${subcmd}       create | edit | ready
#   ${branch}       current branch
#   ${head}         current HEAD sha
#   ${marker_file}  absolute path Claude must write to
#
# Required regex the user's typed message must match (keep in sync with the
# required phrase shown in ack_instruction below):
REQUIRED_MESSAGE_RE='^reviewed:[[:space:]]+[^[:space:]]'

ack_instruction="PR-review acknowledgment required before: ${command}

Branch: ${branch}    HEAD: ${head:0:12}

Invoke the AskUserQuestion tool. The user will pick 'Other' and type their
acknowledgment into the side-panel text field; their typed text comes back
on the question's 'notes' annotation (not the 'answers' field).

Use this AskUserQuestion payload:
  question: 'PR-review acknowledgment for: ${command}
             First confirm the description follows the PR template and has no
             internal/AI narrative, pasted logs, or secrets. Then pick \"Other\"
             and type your acknowledgment in this exact shape:
                 reviewed: <one-line summary, in your own words, of what
                            this PR changes>'
  header:   'PR review'
  options:
    - label: 'Abort — do not file this PR'
      description: 'Cancel the gh command and return to chat.'
    - label: 'Show me the diff first, then re-ask'
      description: 'Run git diff main...HEAD --stat + git log main..HEAD,
                    display output, then re-invoke AskUserQuestion.'
  multiSelect: false

After AskUserQuestion returns:
  • If the user's typed 'notes' text matches ${REQUIRED_MESSAGE_RE}:
      write it verbatim to:
          ${marker_file}
      as:
          { \"branch\": \"${branch}\",
            \"head\":   \"${head}\",
            \"message\": \"<the user's verbatim typed text>\" }
      then retry the same gh command.
  • If the user picked 'Abort — do not file this PR':
      do NOT write marker, do NOT retry; tell the user the PR was aborted
      and ask what they want to do instead.
  • If the user picked 'Show me the diff first, then re-ask':
      run \`git diff main...HEAD --stat && git log main..HEAD --oneline\`,
      show the output, then re-invoke the SAME AskUserQuestion.
  • If the user typed text in 'Other' but it does not match the regex:
      re-invoke the SAME AskUserQuestion with a one-line note explaining
      the required shape. Do NOT write the marker. Do NOT retry yet.

You MUST NOT fabricate, paraphrase, or pre-fill the summary. Only the user's
verbatim typed text from the AskUserQuestion 'Other' field is acceptable as
the ack."
